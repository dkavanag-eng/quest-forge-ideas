## 💡 Sample Prompts & Outputs

### Plot Hook Example

**Input:**
- **Campaign Theme:** "Ancient Ruin"
- **Key Character:** "Gnome Rogue with a gambling problem"
- **Idea Type:** Plot Hook

**Output:**
```
Title: The Whispers of the Obsidian Labyrinth

Summary: Deep beneath the forgotten city of Keth'Amar, an obsidian labyrinth 
holds the treasures of a fallen empire. A gnome rogue with debts to settle 
has acquired a map—but the labyrinth's whispers promise more than gold.

Obstacle: The labyrinth shifts its corridors every hour, and ancient guardians 
still patrol its halls.
```

---

### Combat Encounter Example

**Input:**
- **Campaign Theme:** "Desert Survival"
- **Key Character:** "Nomad Warrior seeking revenge"
- **Idea Type:** Combat Encounter

**Output:**
```
Title: Sandstorm Ambush at the Dune Sea

Summary: A band of desert raiders, led by a nomad warrior seeking vengeance, 
attacks during a blinding sandstorm. Visibility is limited, and the shifting 
sands hide deadly traps.

Obstacle: Players must fight while managing limited visibility and avoiding 
quicksand patches that emerge during the storm.
```

---

### Lore Piece Example

**Input:**
- **Campaign Theme:** "Political Intrigue"
- **Key Character:** "A King in disguise"
- **Idea Type:** Lore Piece

**Output:**
```
Title: The Treaty of Broken Crowns

Summary: Centuries ago, five kingdoms signed the Treaty of Broken Crowns, 
establishing peace through royal intermarriage. Legend says one king signed 
in disguise, his true identity lost to history—and his bloodline holds claim 
to all five thrones.

Obstacle: Ancient records were deliberately destroyed. Uncovering the truth 
requires deciphering coded royal genealogies hidden across the kingdoms.
```
